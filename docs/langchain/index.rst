Langchain
==================

Welcome to Lanarky documentation for the Langchain framework. Langchain is a popular framework to build
applications on top of available LLMs. While Langchain handles the core logic of the application, it lacks
the deployment requirements to make your application production ready.

This is where Lanarky comes in. Built on top of FastAPI, Lanarky provides a flexible deployment solution for
your Langchain application.
